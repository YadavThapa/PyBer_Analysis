# PyBer_Analysis

# Project Overview
V. Isualize gave an assignment to Omar and he wanted to know the ride-sharing data by city type with multiple line chart and he wanted to vizualize total weekly fare per city type for the week period "2019-01-01":"2019-04-29"

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to help Omar to create very dynamic and intereactive chart using Pandas and Matplotlib library in Jupyter notebook. Omar uses pivot and resample method in python to summaries the times series date output of Pyber_Data dataframe.

From the above screenshot, we observered that total rides and total drivers are for Rural area found to be lessfor Rural and more for Urban areas. Whereas incase of total fare, average fare per ride and average fare per driver are found to be more for Rural area and less for the Urban area. The following are the summary from our study.

1. Total rides for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities are as 125, 625 and 1,625 respectively.
2. Total Drivers for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities are as 78, 490, 2405 respectively.
3. Similarly, total fares for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities are as $4327.93, $19356.33 and $39854.38 respectivly.
4. Average fare per ride for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities are as $34.62, $30.97 and $24.53 respectively.
5. Average fare per driver for Rural, Suburban and Urban cities are as $$55.49,$39.50 and $16.57 respectively.

We can conclude that, When the number of the total rides and total driver increases then total fare, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver decreases or vice vice-versa.

# Summary

From the attached screenshot, we can conclude that the weekly fare price for the Rural,Suburban and Urban cities are seasonal in nature or cyclical. We have gathered the information that Total fare collected for Rural Areas is less and Total fare collected for the Urban Area is more for the specific time period.

Recommendation
1. If we want to get more fare collected for Rural area, we need to increase the the total rides and total drivers counts.
2. We can increase the total rides in rural area by promoting the marketing campaign and incourage people to utilise the ride sharing facilities.
3. We can increase the total number of driver counts to the rural area by attacting rural people and make them aware with existing facilities. Once they enroll with the ride sharing facilities both enterprise and drivers get benefits.
4. We can encourage people to share the ride, it reduces the cost for them and it generates more revenue to business.
